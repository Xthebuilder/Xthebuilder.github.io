A technical blog documenting my journey from security supervisor to cybersecurity professional, with deep dives into homelab infrastructure, data analysis, and hands-on learning.
📝 What I Write About
Infrastructure & Homelab

Building and maintaining production-level home server environments
Self-hosting privacy-focused services (Pi-hole, Nextcloud, Vaultwarden)
Networking with Tailscale mesh VPN
Linux system administration lessons learned through real-world experience

Data Analysis & Security

Analyzing DNS query patterns and network traffic from my homelab
Privacy implications of modern device behavior
Security fundamentals applied to real infrastructure
Practical cybersecurity concepts through hands-on projects

Learning Journey

Computer Science education insights as a non-traditional student
Balancing full-time work, college, and technical skill development
Career transition strategies from physical security to cybersecurity/IT
Self-directed learning approaches and resource recommendations

Technical How-Tos

Step-by-step guides for homelab projects
Troubleshooting real problems in production environments
Tool comparisons and technology decisions
Setup walkthroughs with lessons learned

🎯 Writing Philosophy
I write to:

Document what I learn - if I can explain it clearly, I understand it
Share practical knowledge - real implementations, not just theory
Build in public - showing the messy learning process, not just polished results
Help others on similar paths - especially non-traditional students and career changers

💡 Why This Blog Exists
Most tech blogs show the finished product. I want to show the process - the questions I asked, the mistakes I made, the research that led to decisions, and the real-world constraints that shaped solutions.
If you're transitioning careers, learning on your own, or building technical skills outside traditional paths, this blog is for you.
