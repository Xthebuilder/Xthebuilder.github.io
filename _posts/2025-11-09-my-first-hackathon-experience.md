# My First Hackathon Experience 🚀

## No Hacking at a Hackathon?

I thought there would be some ethical hacking, maybe some industry cybersecurity talks, things along those lines. What I discovered this weekend was that **Hackathon should really be called a code fest** as that's exactly what goes on at these event spaces.

I attended my first hackathon at **Mira Costa College** this last weekend and I will say it changed my perspective on tech once again. Before going to that event I would've assumed everyone in there are some degree of anti-social or unwelcoming in general. What I experienced was an introduction into my future career field that was very much my type of initiation ritual. I learned through walking through the proverbial fire and diving into the deep end. If I had another choice I would do it all over again.

## The Challenge

The very first challenge I faced was that **I had no team on arrival** and I was maybe one of the three African Americans in the room or event. Thankfully I have skills when it comes to this. I found a team within five minutes at the team formation time/meetup.

After getting a team the real work started - we had to decide what we were going to do. After brainstorming we went with an idea that resonated with me pretty well.

## "Vibe Coding" 🤖

I didn't expect to be of any use when it came to contributing towards the actual coding once I figured out it was a code fest. I have never taken any classes on anything computer science related yet. I have only coded things through the infamous **"vibe coding"** method as I don't see a reason to write boilerplate code.

> I do think if I am compelled to write code then I will, but if I can read code and understand it and also be able to manage what I want from code, then I will not write any code myself.

I was very happy to see the Hackathon allowed AI usage, had an AI vibe coding talk for an hour and also **AI was one of the tracks to compete for**.

## Key Takeaways 💡

All in all I feel I needed to go to this event just to know that:

- ✨ **You don't have to be perfect**
- ✨ **You don't have to be an expert**
- ✨ **You just need to be brave enough to start**

Many things and the rest will follow. After being unsure I'm very happy I decided to just attempt. I had to drive an hour to San Diego but I met so many people and I realized I'm more like them than I imagined.

## Final Thoughts

> Whenever you have a choice to do something new and scary I recommend you do it and then ask yourself: was all that fear rational or just the ancient part of your brain trying to save you with limited info?

I want to thank all the event helpers and coordinators for setting up such an experience for **Community College students**. One day I will look back at this experience as a turning point.

*This hackathon was more than just code - it was about community, courage, and taking that first step into the unknown.* 🌟
